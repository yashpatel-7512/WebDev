<h1>Top 3 Movies by Yash Patel</h1>

<h2>This is my top 3 movies recommended to watch, and by far the best ones you would ever watch.</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>One of THE best movies directed by Christopher Nolan, best sci-fi and completely scientifically accurate.</p>

<h3>Stranger Things</h3>
<p>Not a movie but a really cool series you ought to watch if you like Scifi-cum-fantasy moveis</p>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Mind boggling. That is the only thing I'll have to say for this movie.</p>
